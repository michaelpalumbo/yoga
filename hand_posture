realized this during elizabeth's 6:30am class. When laying on my back near the end, I couldn't consciously relax my fingers back along the floor. i asked her about this, prefacing that i use a computer very often and play guitar, so my hands are likey over-developed in their curve. 

Elizabeth's recommendations:
  + Lie facing down. extend left arm out at 90-degrees, and place right palm under shoulder with thumb just beside chest (as in cobra positioning). Press into right palm and feel the stretch along the whole of the left arm from fingers to chest. 
    + modification: Do this facing a wall. 
    
  + go into tabletop. place hands under shoulders with the heels of the palms facing forward and away from your chest. bend your elbows. the key difference between this version of the stretch you do before class each morning, is the bent elbows. Lets see how it feels to unlock the joints in the arm and shoulders. 
  
My thoughts
  + Press palms together in front of chest. then concentrate on pressing the fingers away from each other while keeping the heels and metacarpus pressing inward, down, keeping the chest open.
